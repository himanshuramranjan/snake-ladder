> Having a 'Normal' class to represent the board elements other than snake and ladder

A normal class (extending the BoardElement) can be added to represent the board cells,
using which we can replace the null check for regular cells of the board. The method
'getEndPosition()' can be overridden to return the startPosition in this class.

The disadvantage will be more mem consumption, as now only snake and ladder
classes are being init now and are assigned memory. In the case of 'Normal' class, we have
to define the object for each normal cell
